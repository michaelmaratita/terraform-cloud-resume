Late last year, I completed a Terraform boot camp hosted by [ExamPro](https://www.exampro.co/). I was exposed to the capabilities of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and how I can leverage it to create complex systems. I also connected with some folks who inspired me to take on this challenge.

This site was fully deployed through GitHub Actions workflows and Terraform. I have documented the steps to complete this project on my [blog](https://blog.michaelmaratita.com/series/cloud-resume)
