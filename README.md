# Cloud Resume Challenge

---
Late last year, I completed a Terraform boot camp hosted by [ExamPro](https://www.exampro.co/). I was exposed to the capabilities of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and how I can leverage it to create complex systems. I also connected with some folks who inspired me to take on this challenge.
